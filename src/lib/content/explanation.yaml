    title: The Research - Understanding Traffic and Transportation
    snippet: Real data from Toronto and cities worldwide shows how giving people transportation choices helps traffic flow better for everyone.
    content: |
      When we're stuck in traffic, it's natural to look for quick solutions. But research shows that removing bike lanes doesn't solve congestion – it often makes it worse. Cities worldwide have found that protected bike lanes help traffic flow by giving people safe alternatives to driving, especially for shorter trips. In Toronto, studies show construction projects and population growth, not bike lanes, are the main causes of current delays.

      Here's what the evidence tells us:
      - Toronto's data shows that on University Avenue, current delays come from construction – not bike lanes[^1]. Data analysis from a 12-month evaluation period following bike lane installation showed "limited to no impacts on motor vehicle travel times."[^1]
      - After installing Bloor Street bike lanes, car travel times increased by just 2-4 minutes at peak hours, while cycling increased. The Bloor Annex BIA has stated that removing the bike lanes would be "disastrous to the neighbourhood" based on their positive impact [^4].
      - Each person who switches from driving to cycling removes one car from rush hour traffic. The result? Better traffic flow for those who need to drive.

    title: Lives at Stake - Making Our Streets Safer for Everyone
    snippet: Over 120 Toronto doctors explain why streets with protected spaces for each type of user are safer for everyone.
    content: |
      When we discuss bike lanes, safety isn't just about cyclists – it's about creating streets that protect everyone. Research from cities across North America shows that streets with protected bike lanes have significantly lower crash rates for all users. Here in Toronto, more than 120 physicians and medical researchers have emphasized that protected bike lanes prevent injuries and save lives. The evidence is clear: when we design streets with dedicated spaces for each type of user, they become safer for everyone.

      - Protected bike lanes on main streets reduce injuries by 44% for all road users – including drivers, pedestrians, and cyclists[^6]. In Portland, overall traffic fatality rates dropped 75% between 1990-2010 as the city expanded its bike network and increased cycling rates[^7].
      - Toronto's University Avenue bike lanes haven't caused any significant safety issues, according to city emergency services. In fact, having designated spaces for different road users makes traffic movements more predictable and reduces conflict points[^8].
      - Over 120 physicians and researchers from Toronto's hospitals signed a letter opposing Bill 212, stating that "the vast majority of traffic-related fatalities – pedestrian and cyclist especially – are preventable" through protected infrastructure[^9]. They emphasize that preventing crashes is far preferable to treating injuries.

    title: The Winter Weather Myth
    snippet: Discover how winter cycling is thriving in Toronto and cities with even harsher winters.
    content: |
      The idea that Toronto's bike lanes sit empty in winter is a common misconception. City data shows significant year-round use of our bike lanes, with winter cycling growing steadily each year. Cities with similar or harsher winters like Montreal, Minneapolis, and Copenhagen have proven that winter cycling thrives when people have safe infrastructure and proper maintenance.

      - Toronto's cycling counts show winter ridership is growing, with winter cycling volumes on Yonge Street increasing by more than 50% between 2022/2023 and 2023/2024. Even in winter months, the daily average is 34% of summer cycling volumes across major routes[^10].
      - Montreal, which experiences colder temperatures and more snowfall than Toronto, maintains an extensive network of 1,065 kilometers of bike lanes year-round, demonstrating that winter weather isn't an insurmountable barrier[^12].
      - A 2019 City of Toronto study found that 44% of Torontonians bike in good weather, with 70% of residents cycling in some capacity throughout the year[^13].

    title: Emergency Access and Safety
    snippet: See how Hospital Row's bike lanes were designed with emergency services to help first responders navigate busy streets.
    content: |
      A key concern about bike lanes is their impact on emergency response times. When designing the University Avenue bike lanes in 2020, the City of Toronto consulted with emergency services partners and hospital administrators along the corridor. The city's data analysis during a 12-month evaluation period following the street configuration changes showed no reported issues from emergency services regarding traffic on University Avenue[^14].

      The medical community has voiced support for maintaining the bike lanes. In October 2024, over 120 physicians and researchers from the University of Toronto, including those practicing in emergency medicine, trauma, surgery, anesthesiology, intensive care, and other specialties, signed a letter opposing the removal of bike lanes, emphasizing the importance of protected bicycle infrastructure for road safety[^16].

    title: Side Streets Aren't the Solution
    snippet: Why moving bike lanes to side streets creates longer trips and more risks while making destinations harder to reach.
    content: |
      While moving bike lanes to side streets might seem like a simple solution, the reality is more complex. Many of Toronto's key destinations are located along major roads. In Etobicoke, for example, moving the Bloor Street bike lanes to side streets would add about two kilometers and 15-20 minutes to trips due to natural barriers. As Cycle Toronto Executive Director Michael Longfield explains: 'Looking at the Bloor bikeway in Etobicoke, it's crossing two ravines, two rivers... The neighborhood side streets don't make those types of crossings.'[^18]

    title: Climate Action Starts on Our Streets
    snippet: Making cycling safe for short trips is one of our most effective tools for improving air quality.
    content: |
      Transportation is Ontario's largest source of emissions, with road transportation responsible for more than a quarter of the province's total greenhouse gas emissions[^1]. While the climate crisis can feel overwhelming, evidence shows that well-designed bike lanes offer one of our most practical and cost-effective tools for reducing emissions.

      - Research shows that choosing a bike instead of a car just once a day reduces an individual's transportation-related carbon emissions by 67%[^1].
      - The Canadian Paediatric Society strongly endorses protected bike lanes as a way to protect children and create safer, healthier communities[^2].
      - The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is unequivocal: "Targets to reduce carbon emissions by 2030 in line with the 1.5-degree limit for global warming cannot be achieved without a systematic increase of cycling."[^1]

    title: A Better Path Forward
    snippet: How other cities create streets that work better for everyone by improving rather than removing infrastructure.
    content: |
      Rather than removing infrastructure that thousands of Torontonians rely on daily, let's focus on optimizing what works and solving specific challenges. Cities across Canada have shown us that with thoughtful design and community input, we can create streets that work better for everyone - whether they walk, bike, take transit, or drive.

      - Montreal demonstrates what's possible in a Canadian climate. They've grown their cycling network to over 1,000 kilometers through careful planning and extensive community consultation. When implementing new protected lanes, they've learned to spend more time consulting with residents and businesses to address concerns early[^26].
      - Research examining 12 major U.S. cities found that places investing in high-quality bike infrastructure saw improved safety outcomes for all road users[^27]. This suggests Toronto would benefit more from improving existing infrastructure than removing it.
      - Local data shows the value of existing lanes - the Bloor Annex BIA reports increased business activity along the corridor since bike lanes were installed in 2016[^28]. This demonstrates how well-designed bike infrastructure can support both safety and local economic vitality.

    title: Responsible Use of Your Tax Dollars
    snippet: Why removing recently installed bike lanes would waste millions while potentially harming local businesses.
    content: |
      The cost of removing existing bike lanes isn't just about safety and transportation - it's about fiscal responsibility. The province's plan would require spending millions in taxpayer dollars to remove infrastructure that was recently installed and is actively being used[^1].

      - Toronto's city manager Paul Johnson confirms that millions of dollars in planning, consultation, and construction costs went into installing the bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge, and University Avenue. He argues that Toronto taxpayers shouldn't have to pay twice - once for installation and again for removal[^29].
      - The Bloor Annex Business Improvement Area (BIA) data shows that local businesses have adapted and thrived with the current bike lanes. The BIA warns that removing these lanes would be "disastrous to the neighbourhood"[^30].
      - The city would be required to "provide support to facilitate the removal" of the lanes[^4], creating new costs that could be better spent on improving our streets for everyone.
