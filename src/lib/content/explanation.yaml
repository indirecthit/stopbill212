    title: Safer Streets Save Lives
    snippet: Doctors support bike lanes because they prevent crashes and help ambulances move more reliably.
    content: |
      Whether we're walking, driving, or biking, we all want to get home safely to our families. When streets have clear spaces for everyone, they become more predictable and safer for all users. 

      The evidence is compelling: communities with well-designed streets see injuries decrease by 44% for all road users - including drivers[^1]. Over 120 Toronto physicians support this approach, noting how dedicated spaces make traffic movements more predictable and help emergency vehicles navigate efficiently[^2].

    title: Smart Solutions for Traffic Flow
    snippet: Bike lanes give people transportation choices, creating more space for drivers who need it.

      We all feel the frustration of sitting in traffic. Recent studies of Toronto's University Avenue found that construction projects, not street design, cause current delays[^3]. When people have safe alternatives for shorter trips, it creates more road space for those who need to drive.

      The Bloor Street experience proves this works. Local businesses report more regular customers, with people finding it easier to stop and shop, whether they drive, walk, or bike[^4].

    title: Year-Round Community Benefits
    snippet: One-third of summer cycling continues through winter, while local businesses report increased customers year-round.

      Our streets stay active all year, with winter cycling volumes on major routes averaging 34% of summer volumes[^5]. Montreal shows what's possible, maintaining over 1,000 kilometers of year-round bike lanes in an even colder climate than ours[^6].

      Local businesses are thriving with these improvements. The Bloor Annex Business Association reports increased foot traffic and more regular customers throughout the year, benefiting shops and restaurants across our community[^7].

    title: A Smart Investment
    snippet: Removing bike lanes would waste millions in taxpayer dollars and hurt thriving local businesses.
    content: |
      Well-designed streets with space for everyone cost less to maintain over time and help businesses thrive. Recent improvements required significant investment in planning, consultation, and construction[^8]. By preserving and optimizing this infrastructure, we can create streets that work better for everyone - whether you walk, drive, bike, or take transit.
