    Our streets should work for everyone - from kids heading to school to seniors visiting the park. Protected lanes make that possible. Would mean a lot if you could take a minute to tell your MPP you support keeping our cities safe: {link}

    The Ontario government is proposing a framework that would require provincial approval for municipal bike lanes and remove existing bike lanes. This policy would create unnecessary barriers to sustainable transportation infrastructure and undermine our right to a healthful environment. We need to act now to protect our communities and the environment.

    Dear {rep},

    I'm writing about Bill 212's plan to remove protected bike lanes in Toronto. This proposal would waste millions in taxpayer dollars to remove safety infrastructure that's working well for our community.
    The evidence is clear:
    - Protected bike lanes reduce deaths and serious injuries by 44% for all road users
    - Toronto's own data shows current traffic delays come from construction projects, not bike lanes
    - Local businesses along Bloor Street report increased customer activity since bike lanes were installed
    - Over 120 Toronto doctors warn that removing these lanes will lead to preventable deaths

    Instead of spending millions to make our streets less safe, let's invest in solutions that help everyone get home safely - whether they drive, walk, bike, or take transit. I urge you to oppose this bill and support evidence-based transportation policies that benefit all Ontarians.

    Sincerely,
    [Your name]

    The province wants to remove the bike lanes I use to get to work next month. I won't feel safe biking without these lanes. Would mean a lot if you could let your MPP know we need safe streets for everyone. Takes 1 min: {link}

    I rely on protected bike lanes to get home safely to my family each day. Research shows these lanes reduce crashes for everyone - and they're working in our community. But the province plans to remove them next month. Would mean the world if you could take a minute to help keep me safe.

    Dear {rep},
    I'm writing about Bill 212 and its plan to remove protected bike lanes that my family and friends rely on daily. Bike lanes are a practical necessity that keeps them safe and helps their budget.

    The evidence shows these lanes prevent crashes and save lives. Toronto's own data confirms that current traffic delays come from construction projects, not bike lanes. Spending millions to remove safety infrastructure that families depend on doesn't seem fiscally responsible when there are better solutions available.

    Would you be willing to discuss alternative approaches that could address traffic concerns while protecting families who rely on safe bike infrastructure?

    Our cities spent years planning and building safer streets, including protected bike lanes that help reduce crashes. Now the province wants us to spend more taxpayer money to tear them out and rebuild the roads again. Let your MPP know you'd rather see our tax dollars used wisely: {link}
  ask: >
    Protected bike lanes help everyone get home safely - whether you drive, walk, or bike. Studies show they reduce crashes and help traffic flow more smoothly by giving people transportation choices. But instead of solving real transportation challenges, the Ontario government wants to spend millions in tax dollars tearing out bike lanes that local communities carefully planned and built. They're asking you to pay twice - once for installation and again for removal - while making our streets less safe for families. Before the province removes bike lanes that help keep your family and friends safe, contact your MPP today to share why safe streets matter to you.

    Dear {rep},

    I'm writing as a concerned constituent about the wasteful spending proposed in Bill 212. The plan to remove recently installed bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge, and University would force taxpayers to pay twice - once for the original installation and again for removal - at a cost of millions of dollars.

    Instead of spending millions to remove safety infrastructure that's working well, couldn't these tax dollars be better invested in actual solutions to traffic congestion, like improving road maintenance or signal timing?

    Other cities that have removed and later reinstalled bike lanes ended up spending three times more than if they'd kept the original infrastructure. Let's learn from their costly mistakes rather than repeat them.

    I urge you to oppose this wasteful spending and focus instead on responsible use of our tax dollars.

    Did you know studies show protected bike lanes reduce crashes for ALL road users - drivers, pedestrians & cyclists? But Ontario wants to remove ours. If you can spare 60 seconds, please tell your MPP you support keeping our community's streets safe: {link} Thanks for considering!

    Every year, too many Ontarians are injured or killed on our roads, but we know how to prevent these tragedies. Cities that maintain protected bike lanes see 44% fewer traffic deaths and serious injuries for all road users - whether they drive, walk, bike, or take transit. Before the province removes bike lanes that help keep your family and friends safe, contact your MPP today to share why safe streets matter to you.

    Dear {rep},
    
    I'm deeply concerned about the safety implications of Bill 212's plan to remove protected bike lanes in Toronto. This isn't just about cyclist safety - research shows that protected bike lanes reduce deaths and serious injuries by 44% for everyone who uses our roads, including drivers and pedestrians.
    
    When we remove these safety features, we put all road users at greater risk. Over 120 Toronto doctors and medical researchers have warned that removing these lanes will lead to preventable injuries and deaths. They see the tragic consequences of unsafe streets firsthand in our emergency rooms.
    
    As your constituent, I ask you to prioritize the safety of all Ontarians and oppose the removal of this proven safety infrastructure. No family should lose a loved one to a preventable traffic death.

    Montreal, Vancouver, and cities worldwide have shown that protected bike lanes help everyone get around better. After adding lanes, Montreal saw smoother traffic flow and fewer crashes for all road users. Worth 60 seconds to tell your MPP you support keeping Ontariio's bike lanes? {link}
  ask: >
    When we're stuck in traffic, it's tempting to blame bike lanes. But evidence from cities around the world shows that removing them won't solve congestion â€“ in fact, it often makes it worse. Protected bike lanes help reduce traffic by giving people a safe alternative for shorter trips, taking cars off the road during rush hour. In Toronto, studies have found that construction and population growth are the real causes of most delays, while bike lanes have had little impact on car travel times. 
  email: |
    Dear {rep},

    I understand the frustration with traffic congestion, but removing bike lanes won't solve the problem. Toronto's own transportation data tells a different story: current delays on major routes like University Avenue are primarily caused by construction projects like the Ontario Line and TTC upgrades, not bike lanes.
    
    In fact, the city's 12-month evaluation showed "limited to no impacts on motor vehicle travel times" after bike lane installation. These lanes actually help reduce congestion by giving people safe alternatives for shorter trips, taking cars off the road during peak hours.
    
    Before we spend millions removing infrastructure based on assumptions, shouldn't we follow the evidence? The data shows bike lanes aren't the cause of our traffic problems - so removing them won't be the solution.

    Even if you don't live in Toronto, this affects communities across Ontario. The province's plan to remove bike lanes sets a concerning precedent for local decision-making everywhere. Would mean a lot if you took a minute to tell your MPP you support letting cities choose what's best for their streets: {link}
  ask: >
    Our streets belong to all of us - whether we drive, walk, or bike. That's why it's so important that local communities have the freedom to gradually improve road safety in ways that work for them. Bike lanes have proven safety benefits in neighborhoods of all sizes. Now the province wants to take away the right of towns and cities to make these important decisions for ourselves. If you believe our communities should have a voice in keeping our streets safe, please take a minute to reach out to your MPP. Let them know you support local choice in how we spend our tax dollars to create thriving, livable streets for all.

    Dear {rep},
    
    I am writing as a concerned citizen of your riding to express my opposition to Bill 212.
    
    My primary objection to this legislation is that it strips away the rights of local communities to make decisions about major infrastructure projects that will profoundly impact them. The sections regarding Highway 413 are a prime example. By forcing through this controversial project, Bill 212 runs roughshod over the wishes of municipalities, conservation authorities, and residents who have raised valid concerns about the highway's impacts on their communities and environment.
    
    Local councils and communities know their own needs best. They deserve to have the autonomy to conduct proper consultations, studies and debates to determine if projects like Highway 413 are truly in their best interests. Bill 212 deprives them of that democratic right and concentrates far too much unilateral power in the provincial government's hands.
    
    No matter where one stands on Highway 413 itself, we should all be alarmed by the precedent Bill 212 sets in eroding local decision-making authority. I urge you to stand up for the democratic rights of the communities you represent by voting against this overreaching legislation.
    
    Thank you for considering my views.

    While rushing through bike lane removals with limited public input, the province is also fast-tracking an $8+ billion highway that experts say won't reduce congestion. Take 60 seconds to ask your MPP to prioritize proven local solutions over costly mega-projects: {link}
  ask: >
    As Ontarians, we all want to see our communities thrive. But the proposed Highway 413 is raising serious questions about how we invest our infrastructure dollars responsibly. Evidence shows that new highways often fail to reduce traffic in the long run, while pulling funds away from more cost-effective transportation options that benefit everyone. Before we commit billions to Highway 413, let's make sure we're investing in projects that truly deliver the greatest public good. Please take a moment to contact your MPP and let them know you support responsible transportation planning.

    Dear {rep},

    As one of your constituents, I am writing to voice my opposition to the Highway 413 project included in Bill 212.

    Highway 413 is projected to cost taxpayers over $6 billion while studies show it would only save drivers 30-60 seconds per trip. It will also pave over thousands of acres of valuable farmland, forests and wetlands in our community, undermining Ontario's environmental protection goals.

    There are far more cost-effective and eco-friendly transportation solutions, such as expanding public transit, improving regional rail, and promoting carpooling. Our tax dollars should be spent on projects that provide real benefits, not billions on an unnecessary highway that will harm our environment.

    I ask you to consider these serious drawbacks and take a stand against Highway 413 when Bill 212 comes to a vote. I would be happy to discuss my concerns with you further.

    Thank you for your service and for considering the views of your constituents on this important issue.
