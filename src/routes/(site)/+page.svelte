        <p>
            Bill 212 would take away local communities' ability to build the safe, vibrant streets we all want. The bill requires provincial approval for bike lanes and mandates removing existing lanes on major roads that help families, seniors and children travel safely. Together, we can keep decisions about our neighborhood streets where they belong - in our communities.
